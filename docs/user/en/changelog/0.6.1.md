# DMS Project Edition 0.6.1

release date: 16 march 2016

codename: [Emilio Largo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilio_Largo)

This release is primarly focused on maintenance and bug fixing.

*Bug Fixes and other enhancements*

- Localization enhancements. 
 - We resolved a couple of regressions in the localization and added more translations
 - Also the Support widget now inherits the language choice of the current user
 - You will see the Institution name instead of an ugly upper case string
- We reworked the search form and we added a couple of hint to it, hope you will find it good
- Enhanced the Document details panel to better show the collection in which a document has been added
- Somehow we missed to show the pagination in the shared with me page if you have more than 12 shared items, now it's there
- We've enhanced the filters visualization to prevent those horrible problems when long collection names are used
- A user must be affiliated to an institution before it can create a Microsite, now we will tell him
- Fixed a bug that prevented the microsite content to be showed while editing
- Prevented to have a false sense of editability of a Public Document when press Edit 
- Now the document preview should correctly show the last version of a document
- We added a little bit of smartness to the collections listings (both under a Project or Personal)
- We fixed also minor things only Project Admins and Administrators will see
- Other couple of enhancements here and there


*Noticeable changes*

- In the collection filters a gray background with a message stating that the collection is locked has been added to highlight that the collection is the current opened one, this will happen only if you have opened a collection (no matter if under a project or personal)
- When the "make button" is clicked it now requires to have at least one document selected, to "make public" an entire collection please use the right click menu on the collection
- Now when a document is already added to a collection we will tell you instead of adding it twice

*Feature*

 - The administrator now has to specify the K-Link Support key to enable the support widget

*Upgrading instructions*

Besides the usual upgrade path is also highly recommended to have a full backup right before the start of the upgrade. 

Is also recommended to run, from the DMS command line, the duplicates cleaning procedure for each collection that has suffered from duplicated documents listing:

`php artisan collections:clean-duplicates {collection}` 

where the `{collection}` parameter is the unique identifier of a collection. The identifier of the collection can be readed in the URL of a collection, for example the url `https://dms.klink.asia/dms/documents/groups/186` refers to the collection `186`, and that number is the identifier required by the command. 

Another point is that the Support Widget will be in the disabled state after the upgrade, you have to contact the K-Link Team to obtain a valid support key to be inserted in Administration > Settings page
