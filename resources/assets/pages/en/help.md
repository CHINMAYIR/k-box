**5. What is the difference between folder on my PC and collection in the K-Link DMS?**

K-Link DMS collections behave differently from folders. You cannot have the same document in two folders on your computer unless a document is a copy. Changing that document in one folder will not replicate in other copies. 
In K-Link DMS, you can have same document located in more than one collection. Same version of the document will appear in all its locations. 

**6. What is the difference between collection and subcollection?**

In the K-Link DMS, internal structure of a Project consists of subcollections. In other words, subcollections make up a collection.

**7. My colleague and I would like to login using same browser. Is that possible?**

We recommend using incognito tabs or different browsers for this purpose. Otherwise, the latest logged-in user account will be active.   


### <a id="projects-activities"></a>Projects activities 


**1. I cannot see the Project collection. Who to contact?**

Please use the ticketing system to contact the K-Link team at `tickets@klink.uservoice.com` or by clicking on the blue question-mark in the bottom-right corner of the system. Alternatively, you can contact your Project Administrator via email.  

**2. I can see the Project collection but how can I get to its subcollections?**

In order to view the internal structuring of a Project collection, please click on its title. 

**3. I can see the Project collection tree but how can I close it now?**

In order to close the Project collection tree, please click on the arrow symbol next to its title.  

**4. I want to upload a document to a Project subcollection. How can I do that?**

There are two ways to upload documents into the Project (sub)collection. It is important to note that the system uploads files to **currently opened (sub)collection**. Once opened, you can:

1. Use the file selector from top navigation bar (Create or Add → Upload)
2. Drag and drop onto the blue area (appears when hover over the files area)

Please see animated image on upload here [https://eba.klink.asia/dms/klink/e23082/document?preview=true](https://eba.klink.asia/dms/klink/e23082/document?preview=true)  

**5. I want to upload a document to a Project subcollection. How do I know the system will upload into the target collection?**

To upload a file into target (sub)collection, you need to make sure it is opened. To do so, please click on the (sub)collection. It should appear in the search bar as well as highlighted white in the left-hand navigation menu. 

Please see animated image on upload here [https://eba.klink.asia/dms/klink/e23082/document?preview=true](https://eba.klink.asia/dms/klink/e23082/document?preview=true) 


**6. I want to upload a file, but it is opening instead. Does the drag and drop not work?**

This behavior emerges with some browsers - typical for Internet Explorer - and is caused by the fact that the file has been drag and dropped outside of the blue upload area.
Please make sure you drag and drop your uploads into the blue field that appears when you hover over the window. 

**7. I uploaded a file, but it does not appear in the Project subcollection. Where can I find it?**

Please go to your Recent to see latest files uploaded. In the details window, you can see the (sub)collection assigned to the document.

**8. I uploaded a file, but it appeared in my Personal. How can I move it under a Project subcollection?**

Please select your file in Personal and drag and drop it into the target subcollection in the left-hand navigation menu.

**11. I want to download a file from the Project collection. How can I do that?** 

Please left-click on the file to open the details window. Select download. If you cannot see download button, you may not have the user permission to perform the action. In this case, please contact your Project Administrator.  

**12. I want to share a document(-s) with another user. How can I do that?**

You have two ways of sharing a document:

1. if you are both in the same Project Collection, you can copy-paste the link to the file from the details window;
2. if you belong to different Project Collections, you can share the document having right-clicked on the file to open the menu. Choose “share” and select one or more users from the list. The recipient will see the document in their “Shared with me” section. 

**13. I want to make a document available for Global search. How can I do that?**

To prevent sharing of non-open source documents, only users with Administrator accounts can employ the feature. Please contact your Project Administrator via email, indicating the document you would like to make public.

**14. How do I know that a document is Public in the K-Link Network?**

When the document is public, it has the globe icon next to title. Private documents will have a lock icon.  


### <a id="my-collections-activities"></a>My Collections activities

### <a id="search"></a>Search

**1. What is K-Link Public?**

K-Link DMS users can search among documents made visible to the K-Link Network by its partners.

**2. How can I help the system find a document?**

Please use comprehensive keywords and boolean operators:

- `OR​`: the operator links two key-words and searches for documents which contain either one of them. When no operator is entered, the `OR` operator is assumed by the system. E.g. `Markhor report 2014` keyword combination is understood by the system as: `Markhor OR report OR 2014`
- `AND​`: matches documents where both terms are used anywhere in the text. E.g. `Markhor AND report AND 2014` will display documents where all the keywords are mentioned. 
- `+​`: a word after this symbol must exist in documents retrieved after search is performed. E.g., `+Markhor` report search will focus on _Markhor_, and will look for _report_ too, but search results might include only documents that match _Markhor_. 
- `NOT​`: terms after this operator must not be used in a retrieved document. 
- `*` - when you do not remember the whole word (common with names/surnames), the symbol can be used to look for beginning or end of the word ( `*` in the end or beginning of the keyword respectively). E.g. `K-Link AND presentation AND Muzafar*` will come back with results where Muzafar will have various endings mentioned in documents. This is the reason why more keywords return better results!  

**3. I want to find a document I have uploaded. How can I do that?**

Please go to Recent to find the latest uploads. For a greater search, please go to your Personal in the left-hand navigation menu and perform a search, using keywords and filtering the results. 

Please refer to animated image: [https://eba.klink.asia/dms/klink/e23082/document?preview=true](https://eba.klink.asia/dms/klink/e23082/document?preview=true)  

**4. I want to find a document in a Project collection. How can I do that?**

Please open the Project collection so that you can see it appear in the search bar and highlighted white in the left-hand navigation menu. Please use comprehensive keywords and filters (see point 2 higher) to find the target information. 

**5. I want to find my latest uploaded file. Where should I look?**

Please go to your Recent in the navigation menu to see latest files uploaded. 

Please refer to animated image [https://eba.klink.asia/dms/klink/e23082/document?preview=true](https://eba.klink.asia/dms/klink/e23082/document?preview=true)  

**6. I want to save several documents in my profile for a faster search. How can I do that?**

You can star a document clicking next to its title and it will appear in “Starred” section in the left-hand navigation menu. 

**7. Where can I find documents shared with me from another Project?**

Please go to “Shared with me” section in the left-hand navigation menu to view documents shared by individual users.

### <a id="errors"></a>Errors

**1. “File exists”**

The document you are trying to upload is either among Personal or Project collections or Trash. Please review your Recent and Trash to make sure you do not have a copy uploaded. You can search Project collections using relevant keywords, if the file was uploaded by your partner. 
Having exhausted the options above, please contact the K-Link team using the ticketing system or your Project Administrator via email to find the document. 

**2. “Cannot delete Collection”**

You tried to delete a Project Collection. Only K-Box Administrator can perform such an action as delete a project. 

**3. “Gateway timeout”**

Poor internet connection results in delay of response from K-Link server.

**4. “Loading problem. Some functionalities may not be available.”**

This message will be showed in case of internet connectivity delay or blocked response. Sometimes the network is slow or under high traffic so everything needed for running the DMS on your browser might not be received. You can refresh the page by clicking the browser refresh button or Ctrl+R on your keyboard. Refreshing the page normally solves the problem. 

**5. “File Upload Error”**

The file you are trying to upload is too larger for the K-DMS. The maximum allowed is 100MB

**6. “File preview cannot be showed” or “File preview error”**

The preview of a document is available only for selected file types. At now only PDF, JPG and PNG images are well supported. Word Documents (created using Office 2010 or above) might raise an error due some elements of the Word processing format not supported or being showed with partial formatting

**7. “A file from the same website url (...)  has been already imported” or “A file from the same origin (...) is already in import or imported”**

This error can occur when performing an import from URL. This is a pre-check of the ability to import an URL in order to reduce the import failure rate. The error states that the exact same page, identified by its URL, has already been imported in the DMS by a user. The criteria that raises the error is the comparison of the webpage URLs. 

For example, if the page (1) `http://www.conservation.org/Pages/default.aspx`  wants to be imported, a check about its existence is made. Even though there might be already URL (2) `http://www.conservation.org/Pages/default.aspx?s=something` in the system, it will not be considered equal to (1) and therefore import will start. An error might be triggered by the search engine indexing if (1) and (2) results in the same exact web page rendering.
