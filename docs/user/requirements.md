## Hardware requirements

- RAM 2GB minimum, suggested 4 GB
- A x86-64 (“64 bit”) processor is required. h264 acceleration is optional, but recommended for the video transcoding feature.
- A minimum of 5GB of free storage space for installation.

## Storage

The K-Box requires 5GB of free space for the [installation](./installation.md). This requirement is generated by the use of Docker images, which are serving the packaged code of the K-Box components.

The storage of documents requires additional space on disk. As a document management platform, we suggest to have at least 200GB of disk space that can be used for documents storage.

Beside the storage required to download the code and to save the documents, the K-Box uses storage space for:

- _the Database_. The database is used to store user accounts and all the organization of the documents:
- _the Search Engine_. The Search Engine creates an index of all document contents to perform document retrieval;
in addition all components stores log information

The used storage space varies according to the usage of the K-Box itself.
