*Important notice*

Due to changes in the security stack, on existing instances you have to change the `APP_KEY` parameter in the `.env` configuration file. The `APP_KEY` must be exactly 16 characters long and must be a substring from character 2 to 17 of the currently used key, otherwise every user must apply for a password reset.
