Old but good bug fixing and a couple of features.

## Changes

- Enhancement to the file already exists message. Now the collection is clickable and the
  document in the collection is highlighted;
- The sidebar on the documents section now list collections in alphabetical order
- Collections filter improvements
 - The collection filters now shows the parent of a collection on mouse over
 - The project icon has been removed and the same color bars are used to 
   identify project and personal collections
 - Available collection filters in a collection are limited to 
   the current collection and its sub-collections. No more collections from other projects or personal
 - Finally fixed the possibility of selecting collections to be considered in AND, 
   i.e. to find documents that are both in two or more collections at the same time
 - No more locked (dark grey) collections in filters 

## Upgrade barometer

No migration or database changes, so a restart and go upgrade is expected
