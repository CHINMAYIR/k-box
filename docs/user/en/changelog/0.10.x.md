This is a patch release for regressions found in previous 0.10.x versions.

## Changes

- Changed label "owned by institution" to "added by" according to users requests
- Resolved bug that prevents the upgrade of Document Descriptor details when a new document version is uploaded. This bug affected also the preview of the new document version
- Better handling of error message visualization 
- Technical enhancement to the `dms:reindex` command
- Technical enhancement to the build pipeline
- Included technical requirements needed to support the K-Link Analytics platform

## Upgrade barometer

This release requires a full document reindexing and a manual upgrade procedure.

**before applying the upgrade procedure please make sure to perform a full backup of the DMS (database and storage)**

After the new Docker image has been referenced go inside the image using the [Docker `exec` command](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/exec/) 

```
$ docker exec -it CONTAINER bash
```

where `CONTAINER` is the name of the DMS running container, similar to `klinkdocker_dmsphp_1`.

When inside the container go to `/var/www/dms` and execute the following procedure:

Step 1: put the DMS in maintenance mode

```
$ php artisan down
```

Step 2: Identify document descriptors that do not report the latest file version details

```
$ php artisan documents:check-latest-version

# possible output
Checking and fixing 70 documents...
The following documents must be reindexed: 28 54 56 81
```

Step 3: Perform a full document reindexing

```
$ php artisan dms:reindex
```

If you have a huge number of files you can use the various options available for the [reindex command](../../developer/commands/reindex-command.md)


Step 4: exit the maintenance mode

```
$ php artisan up
```

## New Project Edit page

The old UI made complicated the action to select new members and remove existing one from the project. Now that page is completly overhauled with a multiple select textbox with autocomplete for selecting users and a new members list.

## Big Changes to the recent page behavior

The recent page now shows the last 1000 updated documents in a timeframe of 3 weeks. All this parameters are configurable.


## Dates are now properly translated

A huge time ago users asked for proper dates translation in the various languages, now are finally here.

## Permanent delete

For your personal documents now every user can permanently delete if the DMS Administrator enables the the permission on your profile. Project Managers can permanently delete a document by default.

The empty trash button will clean your trash entirely, no matter of the selection. If you want to permanently delete a document use the right click menu. And by the way this is also valid for collections.

## Move collection from personal to project updates

Moving a collection from your personal to a project takes into account also the sub-collections of the collection you are moving


## Preliminary Power Point preview

We are building a new foundation for the documents preview and everything starts with Power Point. In this super-early preview you will be able only to see the text in each slide, but we are working to make it pretty.

## Other features and bug fixes

- Administrators now properly see the project collections of a document in the details panel
- Network Name can be changed
- Rename of "Make public" button to "publish"
