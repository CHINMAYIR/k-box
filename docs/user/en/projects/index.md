# Projects

Projects helps you create communities of user that shares a common goal. Projects can contain documents and collections and are accessible only by authorized users.

A project is created and maintained by a Project Manager (sometimes also called Project Administrator).


## Projects section

The management of the projects is performed from the _Project_ section, which is accessible from the navigation menu if your profile has the Project Management capabilities.

The project must have a name and at least one user other than the project manager.

The project description can contain free text that describes the project.

The _Add users to the project_ field can have multiple values and offers username autocomplete.

If you click inside the field a dropdown list will popup. The list will only contains the users that can be added, in other words all the users that are not already in the project and don't have a Guest profile. From the list also the Project Manager is removed because it is added automatically on save.

![Create Project User Search](./img/dms-projects-user-dropdown-search.JPG)

The user list field has search capabilities, if you start writing the name of a user the dropdown list gets filtered. Keep in mind that the search is performed by checking if the written characters are contained in the username in the same order you wrote.

After inserting the project name and at least one user you can press the _Create Project_ button that is at the very bottom of the page.

If the creation completes without problems you will be redirected to the project details page
